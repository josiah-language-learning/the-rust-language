x = 5
ROOT SCOPE: x is: 5

x + 1
ROOT SCOPE: x has been redefined/shadowed to be: 6

==>	x * 3
	CHILD SCOPE: x has been redefined/shadowed to be: 18

x * 2
ROOT SCOPE: x has been redefined/shadowed yet again to be: 12

ROOT SCOPE: x has been redefined/shadowed to a different type: Hello, world!

x is currently at address: 93852010828079
x is now shadowed to: Hello, world.
x is currently at address: 93852010828183
*Shadowing changed the address*

x is shadowed back to: 'Hello, world!', but is now mut.
x is currently at address: 93852010828079
x is mutated to: Goodbye, Bob!
x is currently at address: 93852010828294
*apparently mutating strings still changes the pointer addr*

x is shadowed to: '5', is still mut.
x is currently at address: 140726535018052
x is mutated to: 10
x is currently at address: 140726535018052
*mutating did NOT change the address in the case of an int*

x is shadowed back to: '5', but is now mut.
x is currently at address: 140726535018412
x is shadowed to: 10
x is currently at address: 140726535018572
*shadowing DID change the address in the case of an int*

CONCLUSION: Strings and Lists must be handled in a special way.
