The value of the tuple is: (500, 6.4, 1)
The inferred type of the tuple is: (i32, f64, i32)
This is how to pretty-print it:
(
    500,
    6.4,
    1,
)
The new shadowed value of the tuple is: (500, 6.4, 1)
The forced/declared type of the tuple is: (i64, f64, u8)

The value of 'a' is: 500
The value of 'b' is: 6.4
The value of 'c' is: 1
The value of 'five_hundred' is: 500
The value of 'six_point_four' is: 6.4
The value of 'one' is: 1
The current location of the tuple is: 140727252478464
The tuple has been shadowed to now be value: (200, 4.6, 3)
The current location of the tuple is: 140727252479216
*As one would expect, shadowing changes the tuple address.*
The tuple is shadowed back to (500, 6.4, 1) but is now mutable.
The current address of the tuple is 140727252479440
TThe tuple is mutated to (200, 4.6, 3), now.
The current address of the tuple is 140727252479440
*The address did not change.*
*This indicates that Rust must not reallocate for Tuples because the types are known at compile time.*
