# Chapter 3

This chapter is on the core Rust datatypes, and is not an exhaustive guide, but
rather a just enough to get started introduction, it appears.

**Note** that I have not used Cargo for anything in this chapter.  This was a
conscious choice as I thought for just some toy and example scripts, using Cargo
was overkill.
